## üîí Security Considerations

**CRITICAL**: This application has significant security limitations:

1. **Client-Side Authentication Only**: Easily bypassable
2. **Visible Credentials**: Source code contains authentication logic
3. **No Data Encryption**: All data stored in plain text locally
4. **No Audit Trail**: No logging of access or modifications
5. **Not HIPAA Compliant**: Cannot be used with real patient data

### Recommended for Production:
- Implement server-side authentication
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Add proper session management
- Implement data encryption
- Add audit logging
- Use secure credential storage

## üìä Data Storage

- All data stored in browser's localStorage
- No external data transmission
- Data persists until browser cache is cleared
- Export/import functionality for data backup

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

For production deployment consider:

- Database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Server-side authentication (JWT, OAuth)
- Email notifications for due dates
- PDF report generation
- Inventory management
- Multi-location support
- Payment gateway integration
