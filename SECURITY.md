# Security Documentation

## Current Security Measures

### Authentication
- Simple client-side authentication using SHA-256 hashing
- Session management with 24-hour expiry
- Credentials are hashed (not stored in plain text)

### Current Credential Hash
- **Username**: Sajeev
- **Password**: 1971
- **Hash**: `982d9e3eb996f559e633f4d194def3761d909f5a3b647d1a851fead67c32c9d1`

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

**This is a CLIENT-SIDE ONLY authentication system for demonstration purposes.**

### Security Limitations:
1. **Client-Side Authentication**: All authentication logic runs in the browser
2. **Visible Source Code**: Anyone can inspect the JavaScript and see the hash
3. **No Server Validation**: No backend to verify credentials
4. **Bypassable**: Users can disable JavaScript or modify code to bypass login
5. **Hash Vulnerability**: The SHA-256 hash can be reverse-engineered or bypassed

### Recommendations for Production Use:

#### For Public Deployment:
1. **Remove Authentication**: Since this is client-side only, consider removing the login entirely for public demos
2. **Add Disclaimer**: Clearly state this is a demonstration application
3. **No Sensitive Data**: Never store real medical or patient information

#### For Secure Implementation:
1. **Server-Side Authentication**: Implement proper backend authentication
2. **HTTPS Only**: Always use SSL/TLS encryption
3. **JWT Tokens**: Use proper token-based authentication
4. **Database Integration**: Store user credentials securely with proper hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement login attempt limiting
6. **Session Management**: Proper server-side session handling
7. **Input Validation**: Server-side input sanitization
8. **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup

## For GitHub Pages Deployment

Since GitHub Pages only serves static files, this application will work as-is but with the security limitations mentioned above.

### Recommended Approach for Public Demo:
1. Remove the authentication system entirely
2. Add a prominent disclaimer about demonstration purposes
3. Use sample/dummy data only
4. Include clear documentation about limitations

### Sample Disclaimer Text:
```
"This is a demonstration application for educational purposes only. 
Do not use with real patient data or in production environments. 
All data is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted anywhere."
```

## Alternative Secure Hosting Options

1. **Vercel/Netlify + Serverless Functions**: For basic server-side authentication
2. **Firebase Authentication**: For Google-based authentication
3. **Auth0**: For enterprise authentication
4. **AWS Cognito**: For AWS-integrated authentication

## Data Security

- All data is stored in browser's localStorage
- No data transmission to external servers
- Data persists only on the local device
- Clearing browser data will remove all information

## Compliance Notes

- Not HIPAA compliant (no encryption, audit logs, etc.)
- Not suitable for real medical equipment tracking
- For demonstration and educational use only
